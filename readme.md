# IIoT Arduino Code for ESP32

## Overview
This repository contains C++ code designed for Internet of Things (IoT) applications using the ESP32 microcontroller. The code can be executed in the Arduino IDE after setting up the necessary environment.

## Requirements

1. **Arduino IDE**: Make sure you have the latest version of the Arduino IDE installed.
2. **ESP32 Board Package**: Install the ESP32 board package for the Arduino IDE. You can do this by:
   - Going to **File > Preferences** and adding the following URL to the "Additional Boards Manager URLs":
     ```
     https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
     ```
   - Then, navigate to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager**, search for "ESP32", and install it.
3. **Arduino Drivers**: Ensure you have the necessary drivers installed for your ESP32.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Go to **File > Open** and select the `.ino` file from the cloned directory.
4. Select your ESP32 board from **Tools > Board**.
5. Select the correct port from **Tools > Port**.
6. Click on the upload button (â†’) to compile and upload the code to your ESP32.

## Usage
Once uploaded, the code will execute on the ESP32 and connect to your configured IIoT setup. Ensure you have set up any required configurations such as Wi-Fi credentials or endpoint URLs in the code.
